'The script uses two worksheets: "Results" as wsInput (data source) and a newly created "R_Output" as wsOutput (where reformatted data is stored).
'The full path of a file is retrieved from cell B3 in wsInput, and the filename is extracted from this path.
'Headers for the new sheet are defined and placed in the first row of wsOutput.
'The macro iterates over each row from row 9 to the last row with data in column 1 in wsInput.
'If columns 1 and 2 in a row have data, corresponding information (including the experiment file name, well, sample name, target name, and Ct) is written to wsOutput.
'The wsOutput is saved as a CSV file in the location "C:\Example", with the filename derived from expFileName.
'The newly created workbook is closed without saving changes as the data has already been exported to a CSV file.
